### Setup

There is no database component to base mode. All data is stored in an array on the server. Before you get started, add a few images to the `public/images` folder and modify the `server/modules/data.js` to include an `id`, `title`, `description` and `path for` each of your images. Each `id` should be a unique number (e.g. 1, 2, 3...).

Running the server code requires `nodemon`. If you don't already have `nodemon`, install it globally with `npm install nodemon --global`.

```
npm install
npm run server
```

Now that the server is running, open a new terminal tab with `cmd + t` and start the react client app.

```
npm run client
```

Between the server and client, you'll need two terminal tabs! Because we're using `nodemon`, both our client side and server side will automatically spin back up when changes are made!
